# Watching Time Tracker

A simple, single-page application to track watching time for movies and TV series.

## Features

- **Log Sessions**: Add details about what you watched (Title, Type, Duration, Date).
- **History View**: See a list of recent watching sessions.
- **Local Storage**: Data is saved in your browser, so it persists between visits.
